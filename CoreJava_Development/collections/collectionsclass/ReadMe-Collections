The java.util.Collections class provides a rich set of 
static utility methods to operate on collections. 
These methods are highly useful for common tasks such as sorting,
 shuffling, finding min/max, counting occurrences, and more. 
 Using these methods can simplify many common programming tasks 
 related to collections, improve code readability, and enhance 
 performance by using well-optimized library functions.
 
 
 Collections.synchronizedMap
 
 Create a HashMap: A regular HashMap is created to store key-value pairs.
Synchronize the HashMap: 
The Collections.synchronizedMap method is used to create a synchronized view of the HashMap. This ensures that all operations on the map are thread-safe.
Access and modify the synchronized map: 
You can access and modify elements in the synchronized map using standard Map operations like put and get.
Iterate over the synchronized map: 
You can iterate over the entries in the synchronized map using a for-each loop.

Collections.synchronizedMap is used to make a Map thread-safe.
All operations on the synchronized map are performed in a synchronized manner, preventing concurrent modifications.
The underlying Map implementation (in this case, a HashMap) remains unchanged.
The synchronized map provides a thread-safe way to access and modify shared data structures.

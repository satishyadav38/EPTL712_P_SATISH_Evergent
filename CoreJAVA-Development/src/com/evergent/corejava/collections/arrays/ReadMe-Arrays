The Arrays.sort() method in Java is a powerful and efficient way to sort arrays. 
It's part of the java.util package and can be used to sort both primitive and 
object arrays. Depending on the type of array, Arrays.sort() 
uses different sorting algorithms optimized for performance,
 like QuickSort, MergeSort, or TimSort.
